Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the files and instructions for Homework 8 of CMSC408. The homework focuses on exploring the World Bank Indicators dataset using SQL. Students will explore the database, make a copy of the countries table, and practice writing SQL queries to analyze the data. The homework also includes creating a report using Quarto to document the database schema and data.

## Learning Objective
This Homework 8 repository is designed for students to learn how to analyze a very large data and run advanced queries using SQL. MySQL is used to connect to the database, make a copy of the country data set, and run test queries on the data. Students will practice writing SQL queries that utilize COUNT(*), JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, and WITH to explore the database. Students will use Quarto to write a report documenting the database and completing tasks.

## Homework Tasks
1. Download the project repo from GitHub. 
2. Use *poetry install* and *poetry shell* to set a virtual environment with necessary python tools and libraries. 
3. Use VSCode to connect to the MySQL server. 
4. Use MySQL and python to practice different SQL queries on the database. Practice using COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, HAVING, WITH, and WHERE in your queries. Practice using nested queries and subqueries.
5. Complete the report.qmd scaffold and render the report using quarto. 
6. Submit the report.html to Canvas and the GitHub repo to Gradescope. 

## Files and Folders
All necessary files are stored in the ./reports folder. Students must create a .env file in the root directory of the repo to store their MySQL credentials. 

## Integrating Tools
This assignment continues to use visual studio code, git, github, quarto, pyenv, python, pandas, and poetry to streamline development and documentation. Students will use MySQL to connect to and build a database on the cmsc-vcu.com server.

## Submission Instructions
This repository should be submitted to GradeScope and the report.html file should be submitted to Canvas.
